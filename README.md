# Popular-DS-Questions
In this project I aim to identify 'best' data science content to write about.
Google search of "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?" led me to Stack Overflow which is part of a question and answer website network called Stack Exchange.

Stack Exchange hosts sites on a multitude of fields and subjects, including mathematics, physics, philosophy, and data science.

Stack Exchange employs a reputation award system for its questions and answers. Each post — each question/answer — is a post that is subject to upvotes and downvotes. This ensures that good posts are easily identifiable.

Being a multidisciplinary field, there a few Stack Exchange websites there are relevant to our goal here:

- Data Science
- Cross Validated — a statistics site
- Artificial Intelligence
- Mathematics
- Stack Overflow

At the time of this writing, Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE) is on the bottom 10 sites sorted by percentage of questions that received answers.

The fact that DSSE is a data science dedicated site (contrarily to the others), coupled with it having a lot of an unanswered questions, makes it an ideal candidate for this investigation.
